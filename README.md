# Fractals

Exploring computational generation and rendering fractals using Python


---

This is primarily an educational tool, mostly for myself, to explore the generation of fractals in Python.

There's a lot of stuff left to do.

## TODO

-[ ] Change backend from Matplotlib to Pillow to directly draw onto a Canvas
-[ ] Improve coloring algorithms
-[ ] Use symmetry across y-axis to cut down time in half
-[ ] Employ multithreading, especially because this problem apparently is _embarrassingly parallel_.
-[ ] Write out similar code for other kinds of fractal sets, like Julia, for instance
-[ ] Create an interface that can control the resolution and type of fractal
-[ ] Create an animation zoom automatedly that zooms into a specific point and renders things on the fly (might have to learn how the perturbative techniques work)
